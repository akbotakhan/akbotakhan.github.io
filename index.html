  <p style="text-align: left; color: black; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">
    Atyrau is the administrative center of the Atyrau region. The city is better known to the general public as the "oil capital" of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It was here that for the first time in the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 17th century, the first oil deposits began to be developed. Then, by the name of the founder, the city received the name Guryev (until 1991) Atyrau is a city that stands right on the border of Europe with Asia. This symbolic border passed over the bridge over the Ural River for many years. And although geographers today dispute this division, the townspeople are still proud of their privileged position as residents of two continents. And city guests, of course, are in a hurry to take pictures at the memorial sign. <br>
